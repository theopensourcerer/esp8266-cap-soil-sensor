/*
Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor

For the Espressif ESP8266

Uses MQTT and custom PCB Sensor to read and transmit a frequency to an MQTT
Broker. The Frequency varies depending on the moisture level of the medium
surrounding the probe.

This code was written and tested using the PlatformIO IDE and the ESP8266-12F
module.
